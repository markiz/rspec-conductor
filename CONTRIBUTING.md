* Bug reports are always appreciated! I'll try to address them as soon as I can
* For the time being, I _will not_ accept code contributions. While it may sound weird at first, this here is not a large library, so I should be able to address all of the issues myself. There is also a question of code ownership, contributor agreements, etc etc, things I simply don't need in my life
* I _might_ accept and implement feature requests that make sense to me. My goal here is to keep a minimalistic zero-dependency kind of library and not expand the scope too much
